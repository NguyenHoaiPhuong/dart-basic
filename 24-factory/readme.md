# Factory Constructors

A factory function is a function that returns an instance of a class.

Dart provides factory keyword to label a default or named constructor. Then it becomes our responsibility to return an instance from this constructor. A factor constructor is generally used to control the instance creation.

For example, we can cache an instance of the class and return the same instance when a user is trying to create new object.
